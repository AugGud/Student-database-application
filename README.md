Introducing my Student Management System, a small yet impactful project I developed for my CV. This system is designed to efficiently manage student information and academic records in a user-friendly manner.

Through my dedication to learning and improvement, I gained valuable insights from a YouTube tutorial while creating this project. I took the opportunity to add new features, enhancing the system's functionality and tailoring it to specific needs.

With my Student Management System, you can effortlessly enroll students, generate unique student IDs, and keep track of essential details like names, grade levels, and course enrollments. The program also provides a clear overview of each student's financial status, including tuition balances and payment tracking.

This project serves as a testament to my skills in object-oriented programming and showcases my ability to apply knowledge gained from various learning resources.
